# Week 4


## Morning Meeting
    - talked about finding errors 
    - quick check on the right direction

## Coding Plan 
    - function to import data in format for plotting/calculation
    - binder function that calculates the intersections between interpolating functions
    - plotting function that zooms in near the intersection and adds the binder intersections
    - plotting function that takes binder intersection temperatures and plots them with their associated system size ratio 
    - critical exponents log-log graphs
    - configure the code generation for susceplitibility and heat capacity
